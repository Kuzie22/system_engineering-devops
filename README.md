# Shell Basics

This repository contains basic shell script files for learning how to use the command line.

Each file does a simple task like:

- Showing the current directory
- Listing files
- Going to the home directory
- Showing hidden files

These scripts were created as part of a DevOps learning project.

## How to Use

2. Go to this folder using `cd`.
